# Python crash course

## Chp 1

I am already initiated to most of concepts discussed in this chapter.

## Ch2

You need to call python with the file to run it in the command line,like
this:
python file.py

And this.title() is referred to as method.

### f-string

### Constants

Constants are represented as all capital letters.

## ch3

### List

A list is mutable throughout the life of
the program, one can:

* Append
* Remove
* Delete
* Changed

### Tuples

Are immutable lists, they do not change:

* Tuple = (1, 2)
* A tuple of one element has trailing comma

But can be reassigned
Tuple = (4, 9)

## Style guide

Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) used to make changes to how python codes are written.

### Indentation

Four spaces are the recommended style guide, however most compilers convert the tab to spaces.

### Line length

Keep to 72 characters per line.

### Blank lines

Insert a blank line between the blocks of code.

## ch9 (classes)

Classes starts with a capital letter and do not end in parenthesis.
The arguments passed to the class are stored in the variables(attributes) by calling
self. on each variable.
And the class can have several methods within it, these represents
what functions the class is capable of.
